# Executive Summary
The project Shooting Food at People with Dietary Issues aims to replicate a similar gameplay to the childhood favorite Plants vs. Zombies game. However, it will involve shooting different food items related to dairy, gluten, and sugar at people who have dietary issues. All food weapons will give a base level of damage, but there will be extra damage given if the food hits someone who has that food sensitivity. For example, if a dinner roll from the bread cannon hits an enemy with a gluten sensitivity, they would receive extra damage.

Gameplay will be implemented using Python and the Python module Pygame. The game will have a fully functional GUI with handdrawn art. The game will be able to be played through the Python IDE PyCharm.

This project aims to solve the problem of boredom. There is simply never enough entertainment to keep the depression at bay. Thus, we, as health warriors, want to assist by creating a game that will assuredly occupy people for at least one hour.
