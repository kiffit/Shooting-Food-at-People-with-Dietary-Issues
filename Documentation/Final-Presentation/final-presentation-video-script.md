# Final Presentation Video Script
## Note
This script was created as a rough outline for the video for the project's final presentation. The video deviated slightly from the outline but still contains the key information needed to fully explain the group's project.

## Script
Anna in frame. 

ANNA:
It’s come to my attention that there’s a group of programmers who think that dietary issues are a subject of mockery. As someone with dietary issues, I took this personally. As someone with a camera, I’ve decided to infiltrate their group posing as a regular documentarian to expose them to the world. Here’s the dossiers I’ve assembled about them.

Fade in pictures of each team member’s introduction page on one side with photo, name, code name, and explanation of duties zoomed up like a PowerPoint on the other side. Anna reads them all off. 

B-roll of group arguing around a table. Cuts to Thomas in frame. 

THOMAS:
What’s the program about?

ANNA (behind camera):
Yeah, what’re you guys making?
 
THOMAS:
Oh, yeah! It’s a game where you shoot food at people with dietary issues. Similar gameplay to the Plants vs. Zombies game. So, we have a peanut turret that like shoots this kid with peanut allergies.

B-roll of Thomas writing at board. 

ANNA (voiceover):
It’s as barbaric as it sounds. It involves shooting different food items related to dairy, gluten, soy, and sugar at people who have dietary issues. All food weapons have a base level of damage, but there's extra damage if the food hits someone who has that food sensitivity. For example, if a baguette from the baguette launcher hits an enemy with a gluten sensitivity, they would receive extra damage.

Thomas in frame. 

THOMAS:
Yeah, it’s going to be awesome. We’ll have a fully functioning GUI and handmade pixel art. I was going to code it in Python, but that’s stupid, so now we’re using C++ with CLion.

ANNA (behind camera):
What’s the point of this game?

THOMAS:
What do you mean?

ANNA (behind camera):
Like why are you making this?

THOMAS:
Why does anyone make a game? Boredom. We, as health warriors, want to assist by creating a game that will assuredly occupy people for at least one hour.

ANNA (behind camera):
Right. Health warriors. Who want to hurt people with dietary issues.

THOMAS:
Exactly. You get it.

KADE (in background):
*evil laugh*

Kade in frame wearing balaclava. 

ANNA (behind camera):
Can you take off the hat?

KADE:
No.

ANNA (behind camera):
Okay, um... What’s kind of the scope of this project?

KADE:
Will have: Classes for weapons...enemies...attack functionality. Gameplay loop. GUI. Pixel art. No executable. No extended tests.

B-roll of Thomas writing timeline at board with others watching. 

THOMAS (voiceover):
We have a short timeline – just three weeks. Week 1? Get the game working. Week 2? Get it working better. Week 3? Finish it.

Awkward pause. B-roll of rest of team working. 

ANNA (voiceover):
Could you...elaborate?

THOMAS (voiceover):
What? Oh, sure. Week 1, we’ll get most of the backend functionality working, work a little on the GUI if we have time. Week 2, we’ll finish the GUI and pixel art and integrate both. Week 3, we’ll finish up functionality, add all textures, and some background music.

Cut back to Thomas at board that’s now full of nonsense. 

ANNA (voiceover):
Ah. Makes sense.

Changes to b-roll of team. 

ANNA (voiceover):
While the team was working, I heard them talking about some user stories that were informing their project. I was kind of confused, but I managed to find the documents in someone’s briefcase.

User story pictures fade in and out. 

ANNA (voiceover):
*just reads cards*

Braxton in frame. 

ANNA (behind camera):
What’s the design for this project?

BRAXTON:
It’s a bit crazy, but I made several different diagrams. I made a problem frame, data flow diagram, and some class UML diagrams.

B-roll of Braxton at board writing out data flow diagram. 

ANNA (voiceover):
The diagrams on the board were, well, for a word, nonsensical, but I was able to find the actual finalized diagrams in Braxton’s backpack.

Diagrams start fading in and out across screen during voiceover. 

ANNA (voiceover):
Can you explain the diagrams a bit?

BRAXTON (voiceover):
Oh, yeah. *insert Braxton’s explanation here*

Nate in frame. 

ANNA (behind camera):
So, you worked on the pixel art? What was the inspiration behind this?

NATE:
*goes on school appropriate rant about how much he hates chat gpt*

Hand drawn mockups and pixel art fades in and out as Nate rants.  

Anna in frame. 

ANNA:
I’ve got most of the information about the project. The only thing I don’t have now is the actual source code itself. I -

Big scuffle. Camera knocked down. Black for 15 seconds.  

Comes back into focus on Anna’s face, unalive, in a ditch. 

ALTERNATE ENDING

Comes back into focus. Anna wakes up in a field (Kade’s backyard). Camera pans up, Kade is standing there in ski mask with baguette in hand.  

KADE:
Run.

Anna panics and takes off running. Takes a baguette to the side. Then to the other. Collapses onto knees. Falls down. Unalives. 

KADE:
Bjorn Müller has no enemies.

Walks away ✨dramatically✨ 

THE END
