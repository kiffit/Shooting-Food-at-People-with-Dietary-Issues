# Process

In the style of our chosen SDLC, Big Bang, the process for our project will be very fluid. While we have a rough outline of what the team would like to complete each week, these milestones are flexible and may be adjusted as the project progresses. The week by week tasks that team members will complete are also allowed to be flexible, though if a team member is not completing any tasks, this will be discussed and potentially escalated as needed per the situation.

In order to have a semblance of structure, there will be documentation elements borrowed from both Waterfall and Agile.
